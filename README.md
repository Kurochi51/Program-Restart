# Program-Restart
Some random rust code hacked together that is most likely windows dependant.

Just type down the name of the process you want to restart, and then select the interval of time in-between restarts. <br>
Process name must match, without `.exe` because I was lazy and it's added automatically, otherwise case insensitive.
